# TODO List for TSpy

The High Priority list is made of things that we are actually working on.


## High Priority
- Run the test by other users.
- Implement calculation for tidal stress, strain, and the additional potential (planetary response).
- Incorporate DSK (when they exist) to have a more precise description of Tides on the surface.

## Future Ideas
- Incorporate calculation of planetary models.
